# Cricket Analysis Overview

## 1. Data Collection
- **Sources**: Obtain cricket data from various sources such as:
  - Online databases (Kaggle, ESPNcricinfo).
  - APIs (Cricbuzz API).
  
- **Types of Data**:
  - Player statistics (runs, wickets, averages).
  - Match results (teams, dates, outcomes).
  - Historical performance across formats (ODI, Test, T20).

## 2. Data Preprocessing
- **Cleaning**:
  - Remove duplicates, irrelevant entries, and handle missing values.
  - Convert data types for numerical analysis (e.g., strings to integers/floats).
  
- **Feature Engineering**:
  - Create new metrics (e.g., strike rate, batting average, win-loss ratios).
  - Aggregate data for broader insights (e.g., average runs per match).

## 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- **Descriptive Statistics**:
  - Analyze player and team performance metrics.
  
- **Visualizations**:
  - Use plots to understand trends and patterns:
    - Bar charts for player comparisons (total runs, wickets).
    - Histograms for distribution of runs scored.
    - Box plots to visualize performance variability among players.
